# DJI Tello Simulator

This is a Python-based simulator for the DJI Tello drone. The simulator allows you to control the drone using the same commands as the real drone, but instead of controlling a physical drone, it will simulate the movement of the drone in a Pygame window. This can be useful for testing and debugging your code without the need for a physical drone.

## Features

 - Supports all Tello commands, including takeoff, land, move, rotate, etc.
 - Simulates the movement of the drone in a Pygame window
 - Allows you to test and debug your code without the need for a physical drone
 - Can be used to create and test autonomous drone applications

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Pygame library

## Installation

To install the DJI Tello Simulator, simply clone this repository and run the following command:
basic

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

## Usage

To use the DJI Tello Simulator, simply run the test.py file. You can then use the same commands as the real drone to control the simulation. For example, to make the drone take off, you would call the takeoff() method. To make the drone move forward, you would call the move_forward() method.

For more information on how to use the simulator, please refer to the documentation for the DJI Tello SDK.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the simulator, please check the GitHub issue tracker for known issues and solutions. If you cannot find a solution, please open a new issue and provide as much detail as possible.
